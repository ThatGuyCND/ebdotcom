        <div class="intro">
          <h3 class="animate-this">About</h3>
          <h1 class="animate-this">Whom I've Become.</h1>

          <p class="lead drop-cap narrow animate-this">Having vast experience for someone of my age &mdash; so I've been told &mdash; I have been an Auto Mechanic, a Computer and Electronics Technician, a Network Administrator, an Architectural Draftsman and Designer, a Retail Salesman, and &ndash; in my most recent endeavor &ndash; a Software Engineer. Yes, I am an entrepreneur.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-profile__content">
          <p class="animate-this">My current employer, Acquia, has given me the opportunity to define, document, build, and maintain a design system for their multitude of products, properties, and applications. Being my first experience in a large corporate environment, I've gained a lot of useful skills outside of my technical ability. Being a part of a large ecosystem of developers has made me realize that I would like to eventually move into a leadership role wherever I may end up. Essentially owning the design language implementation and ensuring that it's included in the development process for both new and existing applications has motivated me to lead by example.</p>

          <p class="animate-this">Outside of my current experience, I would like the opportunity to build a Design Language framework that is "pluggable", helping other companies and individuals in my industry define, document, build and maintain their own design system. At some point, I would also like to be able to integrate the output of that pluggable system &mdash; a component-based design language &mdash; into my favorite CMS (Drupal) and favorite JS MVC (Angular). The goal being for that work to stand as a reference implementation.</p>

          <p class="animate-this">I regularly attend and present at open source software conferences, but I would like to have the opportunity to more formally teach and train others in my industry. I've gained a vast knowledge of best practices relating to front-end implementations and desire to share with others in my industry. Of course, there are others who design with a component-based approach; my edge comes from my experience developing with multiple methodologies, allowing me to identify and assemble the bease parts of each into one systen.</p>

          <p class="animate-this">I have worked in the auto industry as a mechanic and on general gear-heady projects. I started my intended career as an architect by becoming a draftsman when I was still in high school; during the same time also building and repairing PCs as a side business. When the housing market took a dive in the mid aughts, I morphed my hobby as a digital artist and web developer into my new career. During my transition from Architectural Design and Drafting to Software Engineering I learned a great deal; about life, about running my own business, and especially about the correlary processes between the various industries I've worked in.</p>

          <p class="lead drop-cap narrow animate-this">Skilled at a great many things, and aside from my hobbies there are few things that I thoroughly enjoy when I am able to help others succeed. Below &ndash; in no particular order &ndash; is a list of the types of services that I'm motivated to provide in return for my own monetary gain.</p>

              <h4>Branding</h4>
              <p>Graphic design has long been a passion of mine &mdash; reproducing video game logos by hand, creating logos and branding materials for ficticious businesses I had made-up in my head &mdash; allowing me to flex creative muscles in a digital language. I've not only created brand identities for my own businesses, but have also had my services procured by friends and family for their own endeavors.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-item">
              <h4>UI Design</h4>
              <p>As an Architectural and graphic designer, through my transition into a digital-media designer I understood that static design mockups (Photoshop, etc) were not conducive of effecient web development. Using a mixture of technologies I adopted a design methodology that allows design to be developed in-technology which is conducive of effecient iterative enhancement.</p>

              <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
              <p>There are many parallels between design and engineering. A myriad of professional experiences forced me to develop skills that were &ndash; albeit outside of my comfort zone &ndash; beneficial for my career development. Getting involved with the open source community via <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> development is one of the best experiences of my life thus far and has instilled a sense of "greater good" and "best practice development" in all of the projects that I have taken on since.</p>

              <h4>Photography</h4>
              <p>This is more of a hobby than a claim, but I love taking photographs and editing them; analog or digital, photography is fun. What I have a lot of experience in is art directing photo shoots as this has almost always gone hand in hand with commerce projects that I have worked on.</p>

              <h4>General and Technical Consulting</h4>
              <p>I enjoy giving my opinion to others &mdash; though perhaps, only when it's warranted. The mentors and experts that I've had the opportunity to work with has given me a vast proficiency across many skills and topics. I am by no means an expert in all fields, but my transparent nature and willingness to learn have allowed me to absord knowledge around many areas of interest. Whether you would like me to consult on the Feng Shui of your newly remodelled home, the initial design of said home remodel, or even torque some wrenches on your project car in the garage, I'll make myself and my service knowledge available to you.</p>

              <p>Initially, CND started as a mail-marketing company that designed fliers and other marketing materials for small businesses. Over the last decade it has developed into a Drupal Expert Powerhouse™ because of it's involvement with the open-source <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> project (See you in <a href="https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017">Baltimore</a>). From the early days of CND, Drupal has played a pivotal role: our own business management and marketing relied on it, our client's needs were easily attained with it, and the skillsets of everyone that worked on our projects grew exponentially. Without Drupal, I am unaware of what Cloud NYNE would have become.</p>

              <p>After gaining a bit of knowledge on how to run a business &ndash; the hard way, with no real experience at all &ndash; I thought that it would be a good idea to add to the few years of knowledge I posessed. While only a semester long, this study group gave me insight into how one can cultivate the experiences they desire to have by setting goals and taking action toward achievement; <font font-style="italic">"We are the only ones that stand in our way"</style> is one statement I clearly remember from this course.</p>

              <p>At USF my primary focus was Architecture. I was on track to complete a five (5) year degree program in three (3) years; it was rigorous, and my previous experience helped me stay ahead of the curve. I had to depart when the housing market in FL "crashed." Losing my job, I couldn't afford the expense of my education any longer. While attending shool, I found myself becoming a Founding father of a new Zeta Beta Tau chapter, Gamma Chi. An experience that none-the-less helped me adjust to adult life, but also one that reinforced the leadership skills I had acquired through the FBLA progrm in high school.</p>

              <p>In my junior year I transfered to WPHS where I lived some of the most formative years of my life. I was active in the Future Business Leaders of America program, the Academic team, weightlifting team and numerous other extracurriculars. I excelled in my Drafting class and was often either helping fellow students with their work or hosting a Quake 3™ Tournament. The Web Design & Development class I attended was fun, and I learned a ton, but I quickly outpaced my classmates as my profeciency allowed me to do a lot of experimentation as part of my regular classwork.</p>

            <p>Erik is one of the brightest front-end designers I've had the pleasure of collaborating with. Tenacious in his quest for knowledge, and a stickler for getting it right -- both in terms of providing immense business value to his clients, but also in implementing solutions that follow closely to Web Standards. He's got a keen mind for business and an ever impressive design style. I look forward to collaborating with him again.</p>
